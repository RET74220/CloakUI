# CloakUI
Discreet OpenAI API interface tool

CloakUI is a lightweight desktop program for Windows designed to access OpenAI LLMS with a minimalist and discreet appearance. The window is fixed at a small 430x450 pixels.

- No chat history or conversations are saved, and each input/output is independent from the last.

- The vision button allows the program to quickly see what's on your screen and return with a response

- Autohide automatically locks the window to 95% transparency when the mouse is not hovering over it. You can toggle this on and off easily as well if you would like.

- Shortcuts to move the window without the mouse and flash it's position to the user when it becomes difficult to see.

- Built in humanizer with 3 strengths to reduce likelihood of outputs used in work being flagged as AI

- Unlimited use of powerful GPT models costing just pennies every month even after periods of heavy use through OpenAI's API Platform.

This is my first time releasing this program publicly. My past personal versions had more features not included here due to them not being 100% polished that are likely to be added here in the future:

- Transcription of text on screen for copy-paste blocked items, similar to the current vision option but quicker for text-only data.

- The option to reference previous responses

- Plugins for integrations of your choice (ex. SteathGPT).

- Dynamic window camouflage that tries to match the prominent color behind it.

Stay tuned for updates!
